        Use</h2>
        <p>CW20 Token Generator is a distributed application that runs on the Juno, using
          specially-developed Smart Contracts to enable users to build their CW20 Tokens.
          The Smart Contracts, and the Site, are collectively referred to in these Terms as the "App".</p>
        <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">DISCLAIMER</p>
          <p>CW20 Token Generator and its author are free of any liability regarding Tokens built using this App, and
            the use that is made of them.
            Tokens built on CW20 Token Generator, their projects, their teams, their use of Token (as well as anything
            related to Token) are in no way connected to CW20 Token Generator or its author.</p>
          <p>CW20 Token Generator's code is provided under OSL-3.0 License. Anyone can use it as per their needs.
            The App's purpose is to make people able to tokenize their ideas without coding or paying large amounts for
            it.
            Source code is public and well tested and continuously updated to reduce risk of bugs and introduce language
            optimizations.
            Anyway the purchase of tokens involves a high degree of risk.
            Before acquiring tokens, it is recommended to carefully weighs all the information and risks detailed in
            Token owner's Conditions.</p></div>
        <h3 id="the-app"><a href="#the-app" class="header-anchor">#</a> The App</h3>
        <p>To most easily use the App, you must first install a browser extension called Keplr.
          Keplr is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using JUNO
          cryptocurrency.
          You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through Keplr.
          Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Juno. You understand
          that your JUNO public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.
          We neither own nor control Keplr, the Juno, or any other third party site, product, or
          service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of
          the App.
          We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any
          damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third
          parties.</p>
        <h3 id="fees-and-payment"><a href="#fees-and-payment" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fees and Payment</h3>
        <p>If you elect to build a CW20 Token on the App, or with or from other users via the App, any financial
          transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Juno via Keplr.
          We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to
          reverse or refund any transactions.
          With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may
          arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any
          other transactions that you conduct via the Juno or Keplr.
          Juno requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs
          on the Juno. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Binance
          Smart Chain. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.
          In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a transaction via the App, you
          authorize us to collect a commission of an amount of JUNO of the total value of that transaction (each, a
          “Commission”). Commission will be publicly visible on the App confirmation page and in Keplr confirmation
          popup.
          You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the Juno as part of your payment.
          We will not collect a Commission for interactions that do not involve our App.</p>
        <h3 id="risks"><a href="#risks" class="header-anchor">#</a> Risks</h3>
        <p>You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using the App, and for any
          consequences thereof.
          The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets
          could materially and adversely affect the value of your CW20 Token, which may also be subject to significant
          price volatility.
          You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your CW20-related transactions. We
          are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the
          Smart Contracts.
          The App does not store, send, or receive CW20. This is because CW20 exists only by virtue of the ownership
          record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain in the Juno. Any transfer of CW20 occurs
          within the supporting blockchain in the Juno, and not on the App.
          There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of
          hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that
          third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and
          acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions
          or delays you may experience when using the Juno, however caused.
          The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new
          regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the CW20s ecosystem, and therefore
          the potential utility or value of CW20s.
          Upgrades Juno, a hard fork in the Juno, or a change in how
          transactions are confirmed on the Juno may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains
          using the CW20 standard.</p>
        <h3 id="external-sites"><a href="#external-sites" class="header-anchor">#</a> External Sites</h3>
        <p>The App may include hyperlinks to other websites or resources (collectively, “External Sites”), which are
          provided solely as a convenience to our users.
          We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the
          availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on
          or made available from any External Sites.
          Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as
          a result of the availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by
          you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made
          available from, any External Sites.</p>

        <p>We may make changes to the Terms from time to time.
          Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Any changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they
          are made, and your continued access to or use of the App after the Terms have been updated will constitute
          your binding acceptance of the updates.
          If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you may not access or use the App.</p>
        <h3 id="changes-to-the-app"><a href="#changes-to-the-app" class="header-anchor">#</a> Changes to the App</h3>
        <p>We are constantly innovating the App to help provide the best possible experience. You acknowledge and agree
          that the form and nature of the App, and any part of it, may change from time to time without prior notice to
          you, and that we may add new features and change any part of the App at any time without notice.</p>

          What information do we collect?</h3>
        <p>When you build a CW20 you are prompted to enter Token Name and Symbol, the decimals amount and Token supply.
          The above informations are stored in the Juno as a requirement for your CW20 to work.
          We do not collect your wallet address but you only use it to create the CW20 Token on the blockchain. So,
          wallet addresses are visible on the blockchain using whatever explorer you want so, if you understand the
          blockchain, you already know that we cannot hide these data.
          In the end the good news is that we do not collect anything from the above data.
          We will never ask you to share your private keys.
          We may collect data about your device and how you and your device interact with our App. We may also collect
          data about your device and the network you use to connect to our App; this may include data such as browser
          type, operating system, and referring URLs. Data are anonymized, we do not collect your IP and everything is
          deleted after 26 months so, do not worry about your data.</p>
